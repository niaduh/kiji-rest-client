# kijirest-client gem

This gem provides wrapper classes around accessing and managing a KijiREST server. There
are two modules:

*  KijiRest::Client - Provides a client interface for accessing KijiREST
*  KijiRest::Server - Provides a server side interface for starting/stopping a local KijiREST
   server assuming that the user running this code is the same user who can start/stop the server.

# Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'kijirest-client'

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install kijirest-client

# Usage

## KijiRest::Client

    require 'kijirest/client'

    # Construct a new client pointing at localhost:8080
    c=KijiRest::Client.new("http://localhost:8080")

    # List instances
    instances = c.instances

    # List tables for a known instance ("dota2")
    tables = c.tables("dota2")

    # Fetch the rowKey
    rowkey = c.rowkey("dota2","matches",8675309)

    # Let's create a new entity with
    new_eid=KijiRest::Client.format_entity_id(8675310)

    # Fetch the row by the actual rowkey
    row_hash=c.row("dota2","matches",rowkey)

    # Change the value of the cell whose columnQualifier is "cluster" to 300
    row_hash["cells"].each {|cell|
      if cell["columnQualifier"] == "cluster"
        cell["value"] = 300
        break
      end
      }

    # Set the entity_id key to the new entity_id we wish to create
    row_hash[KijiRest::Client::ENTITY_ID] = new_eid

    # Write the new row. The final argument is what dictates whether or not to strip
    # timestamps from an existing row_hash or not. This is handy if you are using the results
    # from the GET of another row to write a new row.
    puts c.write_row("dota2","matches",row_hash,true)

## KijiRest::Server

    require 'kijirest/server'

    # Construct a new server object passing in the location where the kiji-rest application
    # resides. Note: The owner of the kiji-rest folder must be the same user who is running
    # this code else an exception will be raised.
    s = KijiRest::Server.new("/path/to/kiji-rest")

    # Launch the KijiREST server setting the cluster to .env and the array of visible instances
    # to ["default"]. The final argument indicates to wait for the server to finish launching
    # before returning.
    s.start(".env",["default"], true)

    # Get a reference to a new client pointing at
    # http://localhost:<port set in conf/configuration.yml>
    c = s.new_client

    # Get a list of instances.
    puts c.instances

    # Let's stop the server and wait for the server to shutdown before returning.
    s.stop(true)
